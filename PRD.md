# Product Requirements Document: UX Friction Analyzer

## Overview

UX Friction Analyzer is a comprehensive tool designed to help product teams identify, analyze, and resolve friction points in user journeys. By visualizing where users struggle, teams can make data-driven decisions to improve user experience and increase conversions.

## Problem Statement

Product teams often struggle to identify exactly where and why users encounter friction in their journeys. Traditional analytics tools provide quantitative data but lack qualitative insights about user frustration and behavioral patterns. This leads to:

- Missed conversion opportunities
- Higher user abandonment rates
- Difficulty prioritizing UX improvements
- Challenges in communicating UX issues across teams

## Target Users

- UX/UI Designers
- Product Managers
- Conversion Rate Optimization Specialists
- Customer Experience Teams
- Digital Marketers
- Development Teams
