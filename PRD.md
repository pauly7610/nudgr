# Product Requirements Document: UX Friction Analyzer

## Overview

UX Friction Analyzer is a comprehensive tool designed to help product teams identify, analyze, and resolve friction points in user journeys. By visualizing where users struggle, teams can make data-driven decisions to improve user experience and increase conversions.

## Problem Statement

Product teams often struggle to identify exactly where and why users encounter friction in their journeys. Traditional analytics tools provide quantitative data but lack qualitative insights about user frustration and behavioral patterns. This leads to:

- Missed conversion opportunities
- Higher user abandonment rates
- Difficulty prioritizing UX improvements
- Challenges in communicating UX issues across teams

## Target Users

- UX/UI Designers
- Product Managers
- Conversion Rate Optimization Specialists
- Customer Experience Teams
- Digital Marketers
- Development Teams

## Core Features

### 1. Journey Friction Mapping

- Visualize user flows with drop-off rates and friction indicators
- Identify high-friction points with color-coded severity levels
- Compare multiple user cohorts on the same journey
- View historical trends to track improvements over time

### 2. Real-time Friction Alerts

- Receive notifications when unusual friction patterns emerge
- Set custom thresholds for different types of friction events
- Prioritize alerts based on business impact and user volume
- Link directly from alerts to relevant user sessions

### 3. User Cohort Analysis

- Segment users based on behavior, demographics, or technical factors
- Compare friction patterns across different cohorts
- Identify which user groups experience the most friction
- Track conversion rates and friction scores by cohort

### 4. Collaboration Tools

- Real-time whiteboard for team brainstorming and annotations
- Comment and discussion threads linked to specific journey points
- Share journey maps with stakeholders via custom links
- Team presence indicators showing who's viewing the journey

### 5. Session Recordings

- Watch actual user sessions experiencing high friction
- Filter recordings by friction type (rage clicks, form abandonment, etc.)
- Bookmark and share important moments in recordings
- Correlate quantitative metrics with qualitative user behavior

### 6. Journey Creator

- Build custom user journey maps from scratch
- Define expected paths and compare with actual user behavior
- Add annotations and documentation to journey steps
- Export journey maps for presentations and reports

## Technical Requirements

- Real-time data processing and visualization
- Integration with existing analytics platforms
- Secure handling of user session data
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile-responsive interface
- API for custom integrations

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in user journey drop-off rates
- Improved conversion rates for key user flows
- Decreased time to identify and resolve UX issues
- Increased collaboration between product, design, and development teams
- User satisfaction with the platform (measured by NPS)

## Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

- A/B test integration to compare friction between variants
- AI-powered friction prediction based on historical patterns
- Heatmaps integrated directly into journey maps
- User feedback collection at friction points
- Integration with issue tracking systems (Jira, Linear, etc.)
- Advanced notification rules and workflows
- Custom reporting and dashboards

## Competitive Analysis

The UX Friction Analyzer differentiates itself from competitors by:
- Combining quantitative metrics with qualitative user behavior
- Providing real-time alerting of emerging friction issues
- Enabling collaborative problem-solving within the platform
- Focusing specifically on friction points rather than general analytics
- Offering cohort comparison to identify user-specific issues
