## II. Market & User Context

### Problem Statement
Product teams often struggle to identify exactly where and why users encounter friction in their journeys. Traditional analytics tools provide quantitative data but lack qualitative insights about user frustration and behavioral patterns. This leads to:

- Missed conversion opportunities
- Higher user abandonment rates
- Difficulty prioritizing UX improvements
- Challenges in communicating UX issues across teams

For marketing teams specifically, this creates:
- Wasted ad spend on campaigns that lead to high-friction experiences
- Inability to determine if poor campaign performance is due to the ad creative or post-click experience
- Difficulty measuring the impact of UX improvements on marketing KPIs
- Challenges in creating segment-specific optimizations for different traffic sources

> "We spend thousands on ads each month, but can't tell if people are leaving because of our landing page design or because they're just not interested in our offer." - Marketing Director at an e-commerce company

### User Scenarios / Use Cases

1. **Campaign Performance Diagnosis**
   Maria launches a new Facebook campaign for a limited-time promotion. Using the UX Friction Analyzer, she tracks the user journey from ad click to checkout, discovering that 68% of users abandon during the shipping information step. She uses session recordings to observe users struggling with the address validation feature and alerts the development team to fix the issue before scaling the campaign.

2. **Landing Page Optimization**
   David notices that a landing page has a high bounce rate. Using the Journey Friction Map, he identifies that users are experiencing "rage clicks" on what appears to be an image but isn't actually clickable. He creates a task to make this element interactive and monitors the friction score improvement after the change.

3. **Marketing Budget Allocation**
   Sarah uses cohort comparison to determine that users from email campaigns experience significantly less friction than paid social users. She temporarily reallocates budget away from underperforming channels while her team implements the recommended playbooks to improve the social user journey.

4. **Cross-Team Collaboration**
   The marketing team identifies a significant drop-off issue on the pricing page. Using the collaboration tools, they annotate specific friction points, share insights with the product team, and track the resolution process, resulting in a coordinated fix and improved conversion rates.

5. **Friction Alert Response**
   The team receives an automated alert about an unusual spike in form abandonment. They immediately check session recordings, identify a validation error that appeared after a recent update, and work with developers to deploy a hotfix, minimizing the impact on campaign performance.

### Market Opportunity / Business Case

The UX Friction Analyzer addresses a significant market need for solutions that bridge the gap between marketing analytics and user experience optimization. For SaaS companies, e-commerce businesses, and enterprises with digital customer journeys, reducing friction can:
