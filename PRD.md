## II. Market & User Context

### Problem Statement
Marketing teams invest significantly in driving traffic to websites and applications, but lack visibility into where and why potential customers struggle. Current analytics tools provide general metrics but fail to identify specific points of friction that lead to abandoned journeys. Without this insight, teams waste resources optimizing the wrong elements or implementing changes that don't address real user pain points.

Furthermore, marketing teams struggle to identify stale or underperforming content that users are no longer engaging with, leading to wasted resources maintaining unused assets. Specific examples include:

- **Outdated promotional articles** for customer rewards programs (e.g., similar to Chase Dining) that are no longer relevant and confuse users seeking current offers.
- **Low-engagement educational videos** about financial products that haven't been updated in over a year and show declining view counts (e.g., a -90% change in viewership).
- **Legacy landing pages** for past marketing campaigns that still receive traffic but offer outdated information, leading to high bounce rates and poor conversion.
- **Underutilized features** that consume development resources but show minimal user interaction, creating unnecessary complexity in the user experience.

### Target Users / Personas

#### Persona 1: Maria the Marketing Campaign Manager
- **Goals & Motivations**:
  - Optimize campaign landing page performance
  - Maximize return on ad spend
  - Prove marketing campaign effectiveness to leadership
- **Frustrations & Pain Points**:
  - Can't determine why visitors from campaigns don't convert
  - Limited visibility into user behavior after landing page
  - No way to identify specific elements causing friction
  - Struggles to identify which content pieces are still performing well versus those that should be archived (e.g., blog posts from 2022 promoting expired offers that still rank in search results)

#### Persona 2: David the CRO Specialist
- **Goals & Motivations**:
  - Find optimization opportunities in conversion funnels
  - Implement data-driven UX improvements
  - Increase conversion rates across all user journeys
- **Frustrations & Pain Points**:
  - Difficult to prioritize which elements to optimize first
  - Limited visibility into why users abandon forms or checkout flows
  - Can't easily distinguish between authenticated vs. non-authenticated user behavior
  - Cannot identify which educational resources are actually helping users (e.g., product tutorial videos showing 85% drop-off rates within the first 30 seconds)

#### Persona 3: Sarah the Head of Digital Marketing
- **Goals & Motivations**:
  - Improve overall digital experience KPIs
  - Allocate marketing budget effectively
  - Demonstrate marketing's contribution to business goals
- **Frustrations & Pain Points**:
  - Difficult to connect marketing activities to user experience quality
  - No clear visibility into stale or underperforming content
  - Lacks tools to help team collaborate on UX improvements
  - Cannot easily identify resource-intensive content that's no longer delivering value (e.g., interactive calculators that cost $50K to develop but now have usage rates below 0.1% of site traffic)

### User Scenarios / Use Cases

1. **Campaign Performance Diagnosis**:
   Maria launches a new paid search campaign. Using the UX Friction Analyzer, she identifies that users from this campaign are dropping off at the pricing table because of confusion over plan features. She notifies the product team, who clarify the pricing page, resulting in a 20% conversion increase from this traffic source.

2. **Form Optimization**:
   David notices a high drop-off rate in the lead generation form. Using session recordings filtered by high friction incidents, he discovers users struggle with the "company size" field. He simplifies the options, reducing form abandonment by 35%.

3. **Content Performance Analysis**:
   Sarah discovers through the Stale Content Analysis that several marketing resource pages have minimal engagement. She decides to archive outdated content and refresh high-potential articles, resulting in improved SEO performance and resource efficiency.

4. **Cross-Team Collaboration**:
   A marketing campaign drives traffic to a landing page with unexpected friction. The marketing team uses the collaboration tools to annotate specific issues and assign them to different team members. The design team resolves UI issues while the content team clarifies messaging, all within the same shared workspace.

5. **Authenticated vs. Guest Experience Comparison**:
   The team notices different friction patterns between logged-in users and guests. Using the segmentation tools, they discover that authenticated users struggle with account settings while non-authenticated users struggle with product information. This leads to targeted improvements for each user type.

### Market Opportunity / Business Case

Teams are wasting millions on campaigns that lead to broken or confusing digital experiences. Our product ends that cycle. By being the first platform that *treats UX as a measurable marketing metric*, we give teams visibility they've never had before — and the ability to act on it in real-time. No more guessing. No more stale content dragging down performance. This isn't just a product; it's the beginning of a new category.

This product creates value by:
- Reducing wasted marketing spend on campaigns driving traffic to problematic user experiences
- Increasing conversion rates by quickly identifying and resolving friction points
- Improving resource allocation by identifying underperforming content and features
